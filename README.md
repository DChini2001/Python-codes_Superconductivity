# Python-codes_Superconductivity
Python implementation of the gap function and Brillouin zone analysis from the paper "A Mathematical Framework for Unconventional Superconductivity Beyond BCS Theory". This code visualizes the momentum-space structure of a chiral p-wave superconducting gap and supports further exploration of non-BCS pairing symmetries.
